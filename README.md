# White Spot Detection with Binary Imaging

This project uses image processing techniques to detect white spots in an image using binary imaging. The primary method involves converting an image from the RGB color space to the Lab color space, where we detect white spots based on high lightness (L value) and minimal variations in the a (red/green) and b (yellow/blue) channels. This detection is further enhanced with a binary mask, and the results are displayed on an annotated image.

## Key Features
- Upload and process an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG).
- Detect white spots in the image using Lab color space conversion.
- Use binary imaging to highlight the white spots.
- Provide percentage calculation for white spot coverage in the image.
- Allow users to save and download binary and annotated images.
- Interactive interface using Streamlit for a user-friendly experience.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/white-spot-detection.git
cd white-spot-detection
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Using `venv`, you can set up a clean environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following dependencies:

- `Pillow`: For loading and processing images.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations and array handling.
- `streamlit`: For building the interactive web application.
- `scikit-image`: For converting images between different color spaces.
- `opencv-python`: For image manipulation and processing.

### 4. Run the Application

To run the app locally, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser, allowing you to upload images, detect white spots, and interact with the results.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Use the file uploader to upload an image of your choice in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.
2. **Detect White Spots**: After uploading the image, the app processes it, detects white spots, and marks them in red on the annotated image.
3. **Show Binary Image**: You can view the binary image by clicking the "Show Binary Image" button. This will display the white spots detected in black and white.
4. **Save Images**: You can download the binary and annotated images by clicking the "Save Images" button. The images will be saved as `binary_image.png` and `annotated_image.png`.

The app will also display the percentage of white spots in the uploaded image, helping you gauge the coverage of white spots in the image.

## How It Works

### 1. Image Processing Pipeline
- **RGB to Lab Conversion**: The first step is converting the uploaded image from the RGB color space to the Lab color space. This is done using the `skimage.color.rgb2lab()` function. The Lab color space is often better suited for color-based segmentation tasks.
  
- **Thresholding**: We define thresholds for the `L`, `a`, and `b` channels in the Lab color space to identify white spots. Specifically:
  - The `L` (lightness) channel is used to detect high lightness values (indicating brightness).
  - The `a` and `b` channels are used to ensure that the detected spots are not tinted with colors (red/green or yellow/blue).

### 2. Binary Mask
- A binary mask is created by checking whether the pixel values satisfy the thresholds for lightness (`L`) and minimal values for the `a` and `b` channels.
  
- The mask is then converted to a binary image, where white spots are represented by `255` (white), and the rest of the image is `0` (black).

### 3. Annotating the Image
- The white spots detected are overlaid on the original image by setting those pixels to red (RGB: [255, 0, 0]).
  
- The results are displayed as two images:
  - The annotated image, where white spots are highlighted in red.
  - The binary image, showing a black-and-white version of the white spot locations.

### 4. Percentage Calculation
- The percentage of white spots is calculated by dividing the number of white pixels in the binary image by the total number of pixels in the original image.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A fast way to build interactive web applications. It allows for rapid deployment of data science tools and visualizations.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: A Python Imaging Library used to open, manipulate, and save image files.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations on large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Scikit-image**: A collection of algorithms for image processing, used here for RGB to Lab conversion and thresholding.
- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library used for reading and manipulating image files.
